### Project Overview

 The project contains file, and code, to read and write in file. And few stuffs with lambda and filter, that can be used to alter the content of list.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned, how to use I/O file operations about list and lambda function.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I usually opened a file, first and checked if I am not altering contents of file, so I used to save the content of file in variable, then read it. Read the operations thoroughly to understand, what needs to be done.


### Challenges faced

 The challenges, I faced was, I used to not remember the syntax, and so I used to google it. But, to be honest, no syntax, no programming. So, next time, onwards, m gonna give my best to syntax, and then code.
